                    Welcome to OmniPass. By using our platform, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service
                    ("Terms"). These Terms govern your access to and use of our website, services, and subscriptions.
                    Please read them carefully before using our services.
                    2. Service Overview
                    OmniPass offers a subscription-based service that allows users to acquire temporary citizenship in
                    various countries through tiered membership plans. Our service provides access to different levels
                    of citizenship rights, benefits, and experiences based on the selected tier. The availability of
                    specific tiers and countries is dynamic and may change, as outlined below.

                    3.2 Membership Eligibility: Not all individuals are eligible to acquire all membership tiers.
                    Eligibility may be determined by your nationality, residency status, criminal record, or other
                    factors at the discretion of OmniPass and subject to local and international laws.
                    3.3 Compliance with Laws: You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using

                    4.2 Dynamic Tier System: Countries within each tier may shift due to political, social, or economic
